This Java program is a console-based currency converter that allows users to convert between INR, USD, and EUR using predefined exchange rates. It presents a menu for conversions and reads user input to perform the selected conversion. Methods handle each type of conversion, and the program continues to run until the user chooses to quit. For each conversion, it calculates and displays the equivalent amount based on the current exchange rates.
